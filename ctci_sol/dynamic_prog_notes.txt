-- DP is used for optmization problems 
divides the problem to subproblems. Solving subproblems solves the original main problem 
result of each subproblem is stored, this is called memoization

steps:
come up with a way to breakdown the problem to subproblems 
recursively or iteratively solve the sub-problems ans save the results 
use the above results to solve the main problem
